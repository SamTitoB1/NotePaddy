# NotePaddy

Good day!

This was a very small project I had thought of one Evening..

I don't have a Macbook or IPad, but I really liked the way there is a top notch for other operational functions. Me on the other hand I like to take notes, so ah, lets just make a notepad buddy or NotePaddy!

Here you can simply download all the files and head over to /dist/NotePaddy.exe and run the exe I made it functional in a way for a one stop click.

It has AI integration using the Llama2 model which is running on a Ollama instance. 

PLEASE NOTE:

The model is around 3.8Gb, I have included it in the files, so If you don't care for any other models you can simply run the Llama2 model and it works fine..

# Other Remarks
- Note that there is a 5s timeout where the docking notch becomes fully transperant allowing you to work on your full screen, If you want to access it back simply go back to the notch area and it will appear back infront your eyes
