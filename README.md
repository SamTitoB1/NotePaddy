# NotePaddy

Good day!

This was a very small project I had thought of one Evening..

I don't have a Macbook or IPad, but I really liked the way there is a top notch for other operational functions. Me on the other hand I like to take notes, so ah, lets just make a notepad buddy or NotePaddy!

Here you can simply download all the files and head over to /dist/NotePaddy.exe and run the exe I made it functional in a way for a one stop click.

It has AI integration using the Llama2 model which is running on a Ollama instance. 

PLEASE NOTE:

The model preloaded AI model is around 3.8Gb, I have included it in the files, so If you don't care for any other models you can simply run the Llama2 model and it works fine, it works offline, privacy and data stored is locally


# HOW TO USE

Well to simply put it, Click on the Downward Triangle on the most right side to expand

Expanding allows you to add your notes and jot down any ideas you may need!

Want to interact with AI? Write whatever in the box as the prompt or reference any typed item, and hit the AI button and see your interaction before your eyes
**Note that GPU and CPU power is dependent on how fast the AI will provide a response to you.

# Other Remarks
- Note that there is a 5s timeout where the docking notch becomes fully transperant allowing you to work on your full screen, If you want to access it back simply go back to the notch area and it will appear back infront your eyes

- Hate the Top docking?
You can also dock Top, Bottom, Left and Right!
Simply use the Toggle button on the Left of the main bar for your choice

I apologize that when docking left or right there is no title but only the content in your session

Obviously for an Offline Session answers may be wonky, but still functional (Again Dependent on what hardware you have (GPU or CPU))
